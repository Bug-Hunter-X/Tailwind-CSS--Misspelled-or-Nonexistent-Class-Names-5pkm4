This error occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js. The problem arises when you try to use a Tailwind CSS class that doesn't exist or is misspelled.  This usually results in the class not being applied to your element, leading to unexpected styling issues or the absence of styling altogether. For example, if you have a typo in your class name, such as `text-grqy-500` instead of `text-gray-500`, it will not apply the intended style. Another common cause is forgetting to purge unused CSS classes, leading to many classes not being included in the production build.
