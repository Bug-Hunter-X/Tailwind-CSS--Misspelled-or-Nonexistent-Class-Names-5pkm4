The solution involves carefully reviewing all your Tailwind class names for typos, ensuring they match the Tailwind CSS configuration.  Furthermore, purging unused CSS in the build process is crucial.  If using Next.js, configure the `purge` option in your `tailwind.config.js` file to specify the paths to your templates. This ensures only the necessary classes are included in the production build. 

```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  purge: ['./pages/**/*.js', './components/**/*.js'], // Adjust paths as needed
  // ... other Tailwind config
}
```

By meticulously checking for typos and implementing a proper purging strategy, you can eliminate this common error.
